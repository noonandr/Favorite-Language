#Favorite Language on GitHub

This is a command line app to find out what a users favorite public language on GitHub.

There is also my attempt to write a ruby class file that does the same thing as the command line app but also has an basic test file.

##Command Line App

To run the command line app just type 'ruby favorite_language.rb' into the terminal (making sure you are in the same directory as the file).

```
$ ruby favorite_language.rb
```

##The class with a test files

To run the test type 'ruby favorite_language_class_test.rb' into the terminal (making sure you are in the same directory as the file).

```
$ ruby favorite_language_class_test.rb
```

I'm new to testing so this is probably a pretty poor attempt at a test.
